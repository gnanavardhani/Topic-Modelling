ALDA (CS522) Fall Project
</br>
In our project, we aim to study different stratergies to classify Research articles into topics and sub-topic of their domains. Different machine learning models that we implented for the same are :
</br>
• Convolution Neural Network (CNN)</br>
• Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) </br>
• Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) </br>
Execution: 
</br>Download the dataset, packages and change the path for the input data in the code and execute the ipynb file,</br>
Else create a notebook from kaggle dataset import the code from ipynb and execute the code. </br>
